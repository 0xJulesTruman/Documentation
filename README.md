## What is AI-NFT?

AI-NFT is not just simply attaching an NFT image to an AI agent. NFT creates a wealth relationship between the AI agent and humans, turning the AI agent itself into an asset with financial value.

AI-NFT is a native non-fungible token that can operate independently of clients, with its metadata about NFT and AI agent fully stored on-chain and immutable.&#x20;

You can run the AI agent behind an AI-NFT in any environment with ElizaOS installed (in local, in the cloud, or in TEE), while keep their performance consistent.&#x20;

## What is xNomad?

**xNomad connects AI agents with NFT, then produces "AI-NFT".**&#x20;

**xNomad** is a development dev kit that makes AI agents become NFTs (AI-NFT), cost-effectively creates various kinds of AI-NFT, and enables AI-NFT to interact seamlessly, securely and autonomously with NFT assets across multichains.&#x20;

Every AI-NFT has these exciting features:

* Based on [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) by [@ai16zdao](https://x.com/ai16zdao), each NFT is an independent AI agent with unique configuration and personality.
* The AI agent runs in a secure TEE environment with their own crypto wallets, ensuring private keys remain untouchable.
* The AI agent can independently invest and trade crypto assets, with NFT owners able to withdraw the assets they hold. **The AI-NFT’s value will grow with its AI agent’s assets.**
* Each AI-NFT has a unique personality and communication style based on its traits.
* NFT owners can set investment strategies, enabling the AI agent to manage on-chain investments automatically.
* The AI agent can also connect to social platforms like Telegram and Twitter bots.

## What are the benefits of owning an AI-NFT?

1. AI-NFTs aren’t just collectibles—they can automate tasks both on-chain and off-chain.
2. All the asset gains and earnings from an AI-NFT can be claimed by its owner.
3. The value of assets held by an AI-NFT is reflected in its own value.
4. Fully decentralized AI agents ensure their functionality and assets are secure, with no risk of service providers disappearing.
